# Hello-World
SAY ‘HELLO WORLD’ IN 28 DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 


Computers are dumb. They only do what they’re told.
How do you tell a computer what to do? You use a programming language. The very
first thing you’ll do when learning a new programming language is how
to make the computer display “Hello, World”.

There is no perfect programming language, they all
offer something a little different, and there are hundreds of programming
languages with new ones being created every day.

Here is a selection of programming languages that
have a place in the programming hall of fame. They’re all either used
today or have contributed something to the art of computer languages.
